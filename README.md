# Weather Analysis of Oahu

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to examine the weather data, specifically temperature, to determine whether the Surf & Ice Cream shop will do well year round.  In addition to looking at the temperature there was also consideration given to precipitation.


## Results

### Key differences
In the analysis of Oahu weather data there were some key differences that were noticed between the two months examined.  It should be pointed out that the weather in Oahu is relatively the same based on the statistics generated.  The average temperature for both months is in the low 70s and overall the range from minimum to maximum is relatively the same.  Below is the list of main differences seen between June and December.

1. The average temperature in June is warmer than in December
2. In December the minimum temperature is cooler than that of June
3. Between June and December the average amount of precipitation seen is higher in December

### June Temperature and Precipitation
In the month of June the temperature average is in the 70s.  Average precipitation is 0.13 inches.  The summary table below gives a detailed look at the summary stats for the two weather variables.

### December Temperature and Precipitation
For the month of December the average temperature is lower than June.  However, the average precipitation is higher meaning December is a wetter month than June would be.  Refer to the table below for more details on the weather variables in December.

The above image shows precipitation over the course of a year.



## Summary

When examining precipitation over one year from this dataset there are months where the precipitation is much higher than in June and December.  In addition to the one year precipitation, temperature is a good indicator that the weather in terms of warmth will be good for surfing.  The high times for precipitation also happen to occur around the fall and spring when the average temperature is changing more often than in summer and winter when the average temperature is more stable and consistent.

### Additional Queries
These two queries are both extracting the precipitation data for the two months as well as the temperature data to see the relationship between the two.
